- Before you start working, open GitHub Desktop. 
- Click `Fetch origin`. If that button changes to `Pull`, also click that. 
- Make the changes to your files and scripts. 
- Return to GitHub Desktop. 
- Click `Fetch` again to pull in any changes that may have been made while you were working on your files. 
- Write your commit message in the `Summary` box and add any additional text to the `Description`. If you only want to commit a portion of your changes, use the check boxes to select the files/lines you want to commit. 
- Click the blue `Commit` button in the bottom left corner. This will commit your changes to the git system on your local machine. 
- Click `Push origin` (the button that usually says `Fetch`) to push your changes to GitHub so everyone has access to them.
