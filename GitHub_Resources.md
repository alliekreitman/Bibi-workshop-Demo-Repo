https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/viewing-and-comparing-commits/differences-between-commit-views  
There are 2 main ways to find your commit history:  
1. Via file - use this if you are looking for the history from a specific file  
  - On GitHub web browser, locate the file of interest.
  - Click the button that has a little timer on it and says `History`. 
  - Locate the commit you want to look at.
  - Click the icon second from the right that has a little dog-eared page and <> to view what the file looked like at that point in time.  
2. Via commits - use this if you are looking for the history from the entire repository  
  - On GitHub web browser, click the button that has a little timer on it that says `## Commits`.
  - Locate the commit you want to look at.
  - You can click the commit message to see the changes that were made in that commit. Or you can click `<>` to view the what the entire repository looked like at that point in time.
